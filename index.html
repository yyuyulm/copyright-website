      <p>"Copyright is a type of intellectual property that protects <span class = "bold">original works of authorship</span> as soon as an author <span class = "bold">fixes</span> the work in a <span class = "bold">tangible form of expression</span>. In copyright law, there are a lot of different types of works, including paintings, photographs, illustrations, musical compositions, sound recordings, computer programs, books, poems, blog posts, movies, architectural works, plays, and so much more!"</p>

      <h2 class="leftbubble">Hmmm...sounds legit. Who can be a copyright owner?</h2>
      <div class="rightbubble">
        <p>"<span class="bold">Everyone is a copyright owner.</span> Once you create an original work and fix it, like taking a photograph, writing a poem or blog, or recording a new song, you are the author and the owner.</p>
        <p>Companies, organizations, and other people besides the work’s creator can also be copyright owners. Copyright law allows ownership through “works made for hire,” which establishes that works created by an employee within the scope of employment are owned by the employer. The work made for hire doctrine also applies to certain independent contractor relationships, for certain types of commissioned works.</p>
        <p>Copyright ownership can also come from contracts like assignments or from other types of transfers like wills and bequests."</p>

      <h2 class="leftbubble">Wait, so I own copyright? What does that mean?</h2>
      <div class="rightbubble">
        <p>"U.S. copyright law provides copyright owners with the following exclusive rights:<br></p>
        <p style="line-height:2em;">
  1.Reproduce the work in copies or phonorecords.<br>
  2.Prepare derivative works based upon the work.<br>
  3.Distribute copies or phonorecords of the work to the public by sale or other   transfer of ownership or by rental, lease, or lending.<br>
  4.Perform the work publicly if it is a literary, musical, dramatic, or   choreographic work; a pantomime; or a motion picture or other audiovisual work.<br>
  5.Display the work publicly if it is a literary, musical, dramatic, or choreographic work; a pantomime; or a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work. This right also applies to the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work.<br>
  6.Perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission if the work is a sound recording.<br></p>
        <p>Copyright also provides the owner of copyright the right to authorize others to exercise these exclusive rights, subject to certain statutory limitations."</p>

      <h2 class="leftbubble">Wait, that sounds wonderful. That means nobody can copy my stuff, right?</h2>
      <div class="rightbubble">
        <p>Technically correct, unless you approve them to do so.</p>
        <p>But you see, there's also the problem that since everyone is a copyright owner, then you cannot copy everyone else's stuff either. </p>
        <p>Yes yes, I know you would never really want to copy other people's stuff, at least not maliciously, I hope. However, the problem is that you might be doing the copying without knowing, and it is a violation against copyright law, upon which legal actions could take.</p>
        <p>For example, situations like this that are very real and happening all the time across the world wide web:</p>
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/de5ba2c1-6a0d-4dc4-9fdc-ff463ea2996b/ac15773eb0b845f81f46457f1e12e8f82906952bbe7ec52f1bb2a0451d42bdcf_1.jpg?v=1664229446229" id="youtubeimg">
        <p>You see it now right? Copyright can be violated very easily, (not as easy as they make it sound like in the meme), and we all have posted images online that we found on Google search, and probably used some .mp3 file that we did not buy for a video project in school or for fun.</p>
        <p class="subscript">(you might say you did bought it from iTunes, but that still doesn't include the right to redistribute)</p>
        <p class="subscript">(oh also, this applies to softwares and codes,too. Just for my fellow pirates out there.)</p>
      </div>
        
      <h2 class="leftbubble">Damn, that's not looking good. Is there anyway I can post memes without cops knocking on my door?</h2>
      <div class="rightbubble" style="margin-bottom">
        <p>Glad you asked. Here's what you are asking for:</p>
