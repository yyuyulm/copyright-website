      <p><span class="fairusepage">On the website copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/ it is stated that it is possible to use material within the copyright law, and those usage mainly falls under 2 catagories:</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">1. Usage of materials in the public domain.</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">2. Usage of materials under exceptions of fair use.</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">The public domain is made up of materials that are either never been copyright protected, such as facts or discoveries, or materials whose term of protection has ended or expired.</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">Yes, for the saving grace. Copyright protection can (and will) expire.</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">Currently in the US, all created on or after January 1, 1978 have a copyright term of life of the author plus seventy years after the author’s death. If the work is a joint work, the term lasts for seventy years after the last surviving author’s death. For works made for hire and anonymous or pseudonymous works, copyright protection is 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter.</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">Which means most classical music is free for use, as well as paintings, words and plays written by dead medival people.</span></p>
      <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/de5ba2c1-6a0d-4dc4-9fdc-ff463ea2996b/funeral.smile_.jpg?v=1664228001447" id="funeralimg">
      <p><span class="fairusepage">However, specific recent production or performances of those works are not in the public domain, which means most of the recodings one could find are still copyrighted. What we have for free is only the sheet music, available to be performed by us without charge.</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">Yeah, its still not looking good for folks who can't organize a orchestra by themselves.</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">But what about fair use?</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">Here is where things start to become messy. </span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">The legal definition of fair use is quite ambiguous, arguebly meant to be since there cannot be a clear one-size-fit-all definition for it.</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">There are four main factors that contribute to the determination of fair use: the purpose and character of your use; the nature of the copyrighted work; the amount and substantiality of the portion taken; the effect of the use upon the potential market. </span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">Yep, I know I am sounding really vague right now, but there is not much further clarification I can give, excepth the general guildine from, you've guessed it, www.copyright.gov.</span></p>
      <p style="margin:10%"><span class="fairusepage">"Section 107 of the Copyright Act provides the statutory framework for determining whether something is a fair use and identifies certain types of uses—such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research—as examples of activities that may qualify as fair use." </span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">So I guess there are some examples that one can meansure their usage against. Beyond that, there is really no words can be added to futher clarify the issue, unless they are piles of legal cases.</span></p>

      <p class="subscript"><span class="fairusepage">(It's messed up, I know)</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">So, you might wanna ask: "how am I, a regular person who is just surfing the web supposed to know what to include in my vlog or not?"</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">You aren't supposed to, and it probably wouldn't matter if you do.</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">"What?"</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">You see, the copy right law is written before internet was a thing. A time when only giant coporations has the ability to produce and distribute art, music, writing, or whatever copyrighted materials. And what do coporation have?</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">Money? Yes, you are right. More specifically, money for lawyers.</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">You see, even if you are hundred percent confident that your usage is fair use, the onwer of the copyrighted material can still raise a case and bring it to court. The result is most likely that individuals resolving this by paying some amount. Not because their use aren't fair, but they cannot afford to go to court against a full coporeal legal team.</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">Oh also, they can also use your creative work without paying you, because copyright is for the rich who can afford lawsuits.</span></p>
      <p><span class="fairusepage">Checkmate.</span></p>
