      <p>No? Fine, there are other gentler ways.</p>

      <h1>Chapter3:How can we fix this?</h1>
      <p>Despite the recent surge of internet users, there has been some swift action seen in the legal administration benefiting independent creators.</p>
      <p class="subscript">(yeah I know, more than half our lifetime is still a short time in legal timeframe)</p>
      <p>For example, in England, there has been a separete court that is dedicated to solve copyright related cases. The court has a small claims track that allows individuals to file claims without a lawyer, and defend themselves.</p>
      <p>Still sounds terrible? How about we see what it like in the US.</p>
      <p>
        In 2020, the US government passed The Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act (CASE act), which establishes a small claims court-type system within the United States Copyright Office. However, the act is voluntary for both parties, which means if you are suing a coporation, they can just opt out and you have to take it to the expensive court instead. 
      </p>

      <p class="subscript" style="text-align:center">(U!S!A!U!S!A!)</p>
      <p>Oh also, even if they didn't opt out and you miraculously win the case. They can just not pay up since this court does not enforce the judgement. Unless, you guessed it, you take it to the bigger, more expensive court.
      </p>
      <p>Welp, it's not looking so good for the individual creators in this round, but how about the case when big company is suing individuals?
      </p>
      <p>
      Unfortunately, this small claim act also made it cheaper for company to sue a large amount of individuals for their claim. So yeah, the dealer always wins. 
      </p>

      <div style="min-height:20vh;"></div>
      <p>Joke aside. The CASE act is one small step towards the right direction, but it is a step nontheless.</p>
      <p>The power and number of individual creator in this extremely online world is a force that should never be underestiamted. Along with this rise of online creators, there are also alternative solutions of protecting intelectual properies to copyrights. For example, the rise of open source projects, CC0 or MIT licenses, subcription/donation model, and (skeptically) web3 economics.</p>
      <p>
      These alternatives will disrupt the dependency on copyrights, no matter the old legislative and law enforment system like it or not. Changes are coming.
      </p>
      <p>
        May one day the concept of copyright wouldn't even exist?
